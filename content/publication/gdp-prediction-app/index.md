title: "GDP Prediction App"

abstract: For the countries of the world project, after training all of the models, I pickled the best model which used all of the features (Random Forest). I then used Streamlit to create an interactive web app which allows users to adjust the input parameters and predict GDP per capita using the trained Random Forest model. Finally, I deployed the app using Heroku.
